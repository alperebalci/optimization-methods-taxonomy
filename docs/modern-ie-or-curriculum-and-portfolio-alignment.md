# Modern Industrial Engineering / Operations Research Curriculum and Portfolio Alignment

> **Document role:** This is a living portfolio-governance and curriculum-alignment document. It is maintained in the optimization taxonomy repository because it tracks cross-repository coverage, scope decisions, and future priorities rather than book content.

This curriculum is a portfolio-oriented interpretation of what an Industrial Engineering (IE) / Operations Research (OR) program should teach in a data-rich, AI-integrated environment. The goal is not to replace mathematical optimization with machine learning, but to train engineers who can formulate, compute, validate, deploy, and govern decision systems.

## Design principles

1. **Keep the mathematical core.** Linear/integer optimization, networks, probability, stochastic processes, simulation, queueing, and statistics remain foundational.
2. **Teach prediction and prescription together.** Students should know when a predictive model is sufficient, when optimization is required, and how ML and OR can be combined.
3. **Treat data quality as part of modeling.** Missingness, leakage, measurement error, uncertainty, and distribution shift should be explicit parts of the decision model.
4. **Make computational scale visible.** Solver interfaces, sparse modeling, parallelism, GPU acceleration, decomposition, experiment tracking, and reproducibility belong in the curriculum.
5. **Model the sociotechnical system.** Human judgment, adoption, incentives, explainability, fairness, and implementation constraints are part of the engineering problem.
6. **Use evidence, not tool fashion.** Modern methods should be compared against strong classical baselines under reproducible evaluation.

**Finance:** portfolio/risk optimization, market microstructure, derivatives, model validation.

**Healthcare and Public-Service Operations:** patient flow, capacity planning, appointment systems, resource allocation, cost-effectiveness. This should be taught with domain-specific governance rather than as a generic optimization exercise.

## Portfolio alignment

The current Jors Academy portfolio already covers much of the technical core:

- mathematical and computational optimization: `computational-optimization-methods`, `decomposition-and-large-scale-optimization`, `benders-decomposition-methods`
- stochastic/robust decision-making: `stochastic-programming-methods`, `robust-and-distributionally-robust-optimization`, `simulation-optimization-and-uncertainty-quantification`
- scheduling, production, inventory, routing, location, and supply chain: dedicated domain repositories
- ML + OR integration: `decision-focused-learning-and-differentiable-optimization`, `learning-augmented-optimization-solvers`, `constraint-learning-for-industrial-engineering`, `graph-learning-combinatorial-optimization`
- reinforcement and sequential decision-making: `industrial-reinforcement-learning`, `sequential-decision-analytics`
- Industry 4.0 and digital manufacturing: `industry-4.0-lab`, `manufacturing-systems-optimization`
- finance: `banking-and-financial-services-optimization`, `quantitative-trading-and-market-microstructure-optimization`, `derivatives-pricing-hedging-and-xva`
- emerging optimization: `quantum-qubo-hybrid-optimization`

## Recent portfolio additions and scope decisions

The portfolio now closes several previously identified gaps through repository-native projects inside the relevant umbrella repositories:

1. **Fairness-aware and human-centered optimization:** `resource-allocation-optimization` includes explicit fairness-efficiency trade-offs and human-centered allocation guidance.
2. **Statistical quality engineering:** `manufacturing-systems-optimization` includes executable DOE, SPC and capability-analysis material.
3. **Causal operations and experimentation:** `pricing-and-revenue-optimization/projects/causal-operations-and-experimentation` implements randomized ATE estimation, difference-in-differences, AIPW and budgeted treatment policies.
4. **Behavioral operations:** `inventory-optimization-and-control/projects/behavioral-operations-and-human-decision-making` implements behavioral newsvendor bias, anchoring and bounded human overrides.
5. **Market design and incentives:** `resource-allocation-optimization/projects/market-design-mechanism-design-and-incentives` adds welfare-maximizing assignment, VCG payments and stable matching.
6. **Service systems and queueing:** `workforce-optimization-and-analytics/projects/service-systems-and-queueing` adds Erlang C staffing, service-level constraints and simulation validation.
7. **Empirical operations and structural demand:** `pricing-and-revenue-optimization/projects/empirical-operations-and-demand-modeling` adds multinomial-logit demand estimation, elasticities and price optimization.
8. **Project portfolio and project scheduling:** `classical-scheduling-optimization/projects/project-portfolio-and-project-scheduling` adds CPM/PERT, completion-risk simulation and budgeted project selection.
9. **System dynamics for operations:** `robust-and-adaptive-supply-chain-optimization/projects/system-dynamics-for-operations` adds stock-flow feedback, delayed supply lines and bullwhip analysis.
10. **Strategic and adversarial optimization:** `resource-allocation-optimization/projects/adversarial-game-theoretic-optimization` adds Stackelberg security allocation, exact small-network interdiction and finite-scenario robust attacker-defender allocation.
11. **Production decision-system engineering:** `production-planning-optimization/projects/closed-loop-production-decision-system` adds explicit data contracts, primary/fallback planning, auditable recommendations, human overrides, execution feedback and drift-triggered reoptimization.

**Healthcare/public-service operations is intentionally out of scope for the current portfolio.** It is therefore treated as a scope choice rather than an open implementation gap.

Decision-system production engineering now has an explicit reference implementation in `production-planning-optimization/projects/closed-loop-production-decision-system`. It remains a cross-cutting implementation objective: reproducibility, data contracts, monitoring, fallbacks, auditability and deployment controls should continue to be added where they materially affect decision workflows.

## Topics that do not need priority expansion

- **Quantum optimization** is already represented; it should remain an advanced elective rather than a core requirement.
- **Generic blockchain content** should not be included unless tied to a concrete IE/OR decision problem with measurable operational value.
- **Generic MLOps** should not become a standalone OR topic when it can be taught through reproducibility, data contracts, experiment tracking, and deployment of actual decision systems.

## Capstone standard

A modern IE/OR capstone should be considered complete only when it contains:

- a decision statement and stakeholder map;
- a data-quality and leakage audit;
- an explicit mathematical or simulation model;
- at least one strong operational baseline;
- uncertainty/sensitivity analysis;
- computational reproducibility;
- fairness, safety, or implementation constraints where relevant;
- an evaluation protocol separating tuning from final testing;
- a deployment/monitoring plan;
- a limitations section that distinguishes synthetic evidence from real-world claims.

The objective is to graduate engineers who can connect rigorous optimization with data, computation, experimentation, and implementation in complex sociotechnical systems.


## October 2026 evidence reconciliation

A repository-title-only assessment understates the implementation coverage of this portfolio. Concrete queueing, discrete-event simulation, SPC/DOE, causal experimentation, market design, Stackelberg/interdiction, CP-SAT, facility layout, MPC, and CPU first-order LP examples already exist in root packages or `projects/`.

See [the book-to-code crosswalk](book-to-code-crosswalk.md) for exact code paths, and [the coverage audit](portfolio-coverage-audit-2026-10.md) for validation boundaries. Existing coverage does **not** imply research-grade generality: advanced bilevel/MPEC, simulation input distribution fitting and broader variance reduction, production deployment/observability, and genuine GPU kernels are expansion opportunities. Those are tracked as planned research directions, not fabricated implementations. Site names and repository slugs are navigational evidence, not independent reproduction of every numerical claim.


## Normative, behavioral and organizational decision science (October 2026)

The curriculum now has an explicit companion crosswalk for methods that do not reduce to mathematical optimization alone. Read the [decision-science and management coverage review](decision-science-and-management-coverage-2026-10.md) for evidence and scoped implementation status.

- `decision-framing-and-sequential-decision-modeling` defines decision makers, information timing, model traceability, decision tables, structural influence dependencies and bounded human-override governance.
- `management-science` now hosts a tested normative decision-science flagship (Bayesian EVSI, CARA, AHP, group judgments, MAVT, TOPSIS and probability-free robustness) alongside pre-existing capacity expansion and strategic budget cases.
- `resource-allocation-optimization` provides DEA and mechanism-design implementations; `inventory-optimization-and-control` provides a behavioral newsvendor benchmark.
- `classical-scheduling-optimization` provides project risk/portfolio selection; `pricing-and-revenue-optimization` provides experimental treatment decisions and structural demand models; `robust-and-adaptive-supply-chain-optimization` provides stock-flow and agent-based simulation.

**Curriculum distinctions:** Multi-objective optimization produces feasible trade-offs; MCDM requires preference/value elicitation. Forecast scores are not automatically calibrated probability judgments. An influence graph is not causal identification. Monitoring override rates is not a causal estimate of the value of human intervention. Expert elicitation, full RDM/info-gap, multi-attribute utility under risk, process mining and organizational model-risk evaluation remain scoped opportunities.
